        This is a lion. A text, content, or paragraph added next to the image is printed as in a 
        newspaper or news blog web page. This is achieved using these elements of both HTML and CSS.
        Now, the text will be printed on the left side of the image as the image attribute under style
        tab above is given to float towards the right while the text next to it is floated towards the 
        left.
